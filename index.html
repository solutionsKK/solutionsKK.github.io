  Wearables are popular in consumer electronics, most commonly in the form of smartwatches, smart rings and implants. Beyond personal use, wearable technology is now a powerful tool in navigation systems, smart textiles and healthcare innovation. These devices are increasingly integrated into everyday life to monitor activity, enhance communication and even deliver medical treatments. As technology evolves, wearables are being adopted in fields such as sports science, mental health, rehabilitation and workplace safety — making them more than just accessories but essential tools for wellbeing and performance.
