    The Cicret Bracelet is a wristband that turns your arm into a tablet, allowing you to use swipe, tap and pinch gestures along your own appendage instead of on a built-in screen. Naturally, it is possible to also use this device on either wrist for those who are left- or right-handed.

    Thalmic Labs set out to find ways for wearable tech to be less obtrusive and more natural, believing that using your hands and fingers is the most natural way for humans to interact with and control devices. Thalmic Labs found a way to translate natural hand and finger movements through a wearable armband into actionable information for a computer. Its product is called the Myoâ„¢ Gesture Control Armband, an enabling wearable tech platform that has a myriad of application possibilities: presentation control, medical, military, and assisted computer usability for those with disabilities.
