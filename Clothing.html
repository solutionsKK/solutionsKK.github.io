	<p>Data is collected while you are wearing the smart clothing and is transmitted via Bluetooth to the Athos smart phone app. Some of this data the clothing collects using biometric tracking including: muscle activity, heart rate, calorie expenditure and active time versus rest time. It also tracks the level of exertion of key muscle groups such as your pecs and biceps to see if you are really working those muscles as hard as you think you are.  The Athos app is only available for iOS.</p>
