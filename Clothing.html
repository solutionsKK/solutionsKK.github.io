    Data is collected while you are wearing the smart clothing and is transmitted via Bluetooth to the Athos smartphone app. Some of this data the clothing collects using biometric tracking includes: muscle activity, heart rate, calorie expenditure, and active time versus rest time. It also tracks the level of exertion of key muscle groups such as your pecs and biceps to see if you are really working those muscles as hard as you think you are. The Athos app is only available for iOS.

    These smart socks were designed to give parents peace of mind. These little socks track a baby’s heart rate, oxygen levels, and hours asleep. If a baby had a serious issue like a blocked airway or an irregular heartbeat, the parents are alerted — potentially averting a life-threatening situation.
